This is a project for [The Odin Project's JavaScript course.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript)

The webpage DOM is created using only JavaScript.

This section of the course focused on organizing code. Different responsibilities are broken up into modules:

- **render.js**: writes changes to the DOM
- **tabs.js**: creates tabs with switching logic
- **content.js**: contructs site-content fragments
- **index.js**: specifies parameters and runs it all

[Bulma](https://bulma.io) is used for minimal styling.
